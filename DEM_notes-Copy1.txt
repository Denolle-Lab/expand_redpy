1826 = Mount Rainier West
1827 = Mount Rainier East

files are .dem
need to be converted to .tiff
Francesca has code for that, I just used ArcGIS

ArcGIS steps:

input all dem files you want to merge

MERGING STEPS:
1. go to Analysis > Tools > Toolbox > Raster > Raster Dataset > Mosaic to New Raster
2. select all the dem files you want to merge under "input rasters"
3. select output location and under "raster dataset name with extension" put in name.tif
4. chose spatial reference, can select one of the imported dems to use their spatial reference (what I did)
5. select pixel type (I chose 16 bit signed because that's what was in the tutorial I used)
6. other defaults are fine, click "run"
7. now you have 1 tif file that is a merge of all the ones you wanted to merge.

TO GET A HILLSHADE VERSION (can be easier to make out elevation):
1. got to Analysis > Raster Functions > Surface > Hillshade
2. select the merged tif file
3. click "run"
4. now you have a tif file of the hillshade
